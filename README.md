IT tools to collect and disseminate botanical information to the general public. A state of the art of biodiversity informatics allowed highlighting relevant practices and data sources to create a mobile application for the discovery of useful plants and their uses ([GRIN](http://www.ars-grin.gov/)). The tools, developed on a server, enable the automated acquisition of biological and ecological data, from aggregators such as [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org/) or [EOL](http://eol.org/), through Web services that are normalized by the use of API. The information hence collected meet international nomenclatural standards, making easier their treatment and integration into a new system. These data, once indexed in a search engine, are made available on the Internet through several API for their use from mobile terminals. The Android application offers the possibility to explore data through an entry point on plant uses or to contextualize the consultation according to the geographical position of the user.
